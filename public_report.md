# Public Report – Yani Studios Project

## Introduction

Our project aims to create a mobile game startup that values Brazilian culture and brings relevant social themes through accessible narratives and an aesthetic inspired by *cordel* and woodcut art.  
The proposal is to develop a 2D game, focused on accessibility, performance on mid-range devices, and ethical monetization (no pay-to-win, only rewarded ads and cosmetic items).

Yani Studios was born with the mission of strengthening the Brazilian game ecosystem, creating culturally relevant products, and reaching a global audience.

## Sprint 3 – Audience Discovery and Personas

**Progress:**
- Creation of a mixed (quantitative + qualitative) survey to map gaming habits, aesthetic preferences, and monetization acceptance.  
- Development of two representative personas for the target audience:  
  • Pedro Henrique da Silva (Brazilian player)  
  • Emily Johnson (international player, USA)  
- Ensured that game design remained **user-centered** and **culturally inclusive**.
